          Riley sat in front of the glowing interface, watching as lines of data scrolled across the screen. 
          The once chaotic and corrupted NeoVerse logs were now structured, clean, and ready for analysis. 
          Every missing value had been handled, every category encoded, and every scale adjusted. But now, the real challenge began.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-300 text-lg font-mono">
          This was no ordinary investigation. It was time to put everything learned so far to the testâ€”
          not just to understand the data, but to use it to expose the truth hidden within NeoVerseâ€™s virtual landscape.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-300 font-semibold text-lg font-mono">What was their next move?</p>
        <p className="text-gray-300 text-lg font-mono">
          The answer was in the data. It always had been.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-300 text-lg font-mono">
          But this time, there were no clear instructions. Riley wasnâ€™t just following a process anymoreâ€”
          they were leading the investigation. The systemâ€™s guidance was there if needed, but every decision would be theirs to make.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-300 text-lg font-mono">
          The Shadow Collective had evolved, and so must Riley. The tools were all hereâ€”preprocessing techniques, 
          visualization insights, and feature selection strategies. Every graph, every heatmap, every anomaly flagged 
          would push the investigation forward.
